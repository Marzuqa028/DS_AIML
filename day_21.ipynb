    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the data contains input features along with correct output labels. The model learns by mapping inputs (X) to known outputs (y). The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Data has answers/labels.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Predicting house prices\n",
    "Spam email detection\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning is used when the dataset does not contain labeled outputs. The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters in the data.\n",
    "Data has no labels.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Customer segmentation\n",
    "Market basket analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "Learning happens via rewards and penalties.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Self-driving cars\n",
    "Game-playing AI\n",
