    "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where computers learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with fixed rules. In traditional programming, we provide the computer with data and predefined rules to get an output. In Machine Learning, however, we provide the computer with data and the correct outputs, and the system learns the underlying rules or patterns by itself. There are three main types of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning, where the model learns from labeled data (for example, predicting house prices based on past labeled examples); Unsupervised Learning, where the model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (such as customer segmentation using clustering); and Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties (for example, a self-driving car learning to navigate roads or a game-playing AI improving through trial and error)."
